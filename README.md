LineFollowerTemplate
====================

Template to allow extensions of RobotSquare's awesome Customizable Line Following Tracks

RobotSquare.com published a set of PDF templates for creating your own line-following robot tracks, here:
  http://robotsquare.com/2012/11/28/line-following/

The original PDF document can be downloaded from this link:

However I wanted to be able to create my own versions to extend the set, so here is an Inkscape SVG with snap guides for you to play with in creating your own kinds of awesomeness.

Cheers
Mike
